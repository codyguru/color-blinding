First off, I just wanted to say the joy creating this application brought me. I wanted to create something that everyday people could interact with and enjoy, coders and non-coders alike. Although simple, mini games are addictive and bring tons of joy to whoever plays them. I was inspired by mini games like Flappy Bird and Wordle.
I wanted to make a game that was simple yet addictive and share it with my family and friends.
